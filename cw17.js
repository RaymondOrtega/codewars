// Julie is x years older than her brother, and she is also y times as old as him.
//
// Given x and y calculate Julie's age using the function age(x, y).
//
// For example:
//
// Age(6, 3) // returns 9
// Note also that x can be negative, and y can be a decimal.
//
// Age(-15, 0.25) // returns 5
// That is, Julie is 15 years younger and 0.25 times the age of her brother.
//
// Do not concern yourself with the imperfections inherent in dividing by floating point
// numbers, as your answer will be rounded. Also, for the sake of simplicity, Julie is never
//  the same age as her brother.

const age = (x, y) => {
    let brothersAge;
    for(let i=1; i<=10000; i++){
        if(i + x === i * y){
            brothersAge = i;
        }
    }

    return brothersAge + x
